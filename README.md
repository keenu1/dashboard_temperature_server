## Challenges that I faced during the assignment.

1. At first, I struggled due to my workload at my current company, which sometimes required me to work overtime.

2. I began developing the front end using Next.js 15 but encountered compatibility issues with ShadCN UI. After extensive research, which took about half a day, I managed to resolve these issues.

3. After working on the front end, I realized that the project was actually using Next.js 14, so I had to downgrade my setup.

4. While writing tests for the chart, I encountered an issue where the chart wouldn't render, but I eventually resolved it.

5. During deployment, I faced difficulties finding a free hosting service that could connect to my remote database. In the end, I used Railway for both hosting and the database, which took about half a day to set up.

After completing this test, I feel more confident in my backend skills! Thank you, Mr. David Ho, for giving me this opportunity. I hope I met all the assignment requirements.

Thanks, and I hope you're doing well!
